# The Office

The office is open, and there are three employees currently clocked in. It's Jim's birthday today.

You can clock new employees in, and you can always clock out (Stanley wants to leave). You can also filter
employees by typing in any part of their name.

This little app uses
--------
1. NGN Models (event handling (see console log), edit, undo)
2. NGN Store (add, find, and remove models, filtering, and sorting)
3. NGN chassis-overlay components (for dialog boxes)

Exercise
--------
1. Clock Jim's wife (spoiler alert if you've never watched) "Pam Halpert" in. (she was born 1 day after Jim)
2. Pam is now before Jim in the employee list. Why? (Jim's last name is wrong! Edit to the correct 'Halpert')
3. Undo Jim's last name change! Then click undo again to reapply.
4. Fix Michael's last name ('Scott')
5. Filter on "Ha" -- who shows up? -- now filter on "Halpert"
6. Clear the filter
7. Clock Stanley out!
